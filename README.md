# The Odin Project Assignment: "Build Mastermind game with AI"

My implementation of Mastermind - a code-breaking game for two players. Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Wikipedia article</a> for extendet info.

## Installation

Save Mastermind folder in your chosen location

And then inside of it execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

To play the game run:

    ruby Mastermind\run_game\play.rb

Setup mode will begin and you will be able to set:

    1. number of players
    2. Name of each player
    3. Role of each player

After that, play mode will begin and you will be able to setup the code and hack the code.

If you choose to play against AI, you can be either hacker or mastermind. Try to be faster than the AI code breaker!! It's almost perfect :)

## Still in developement stage!!

1. Input should be secured to prevent crushing
2. AI is based on Donald Knuth Five-guess algorithm, but it's not perfect yet. But it is pretty darn good already :)
